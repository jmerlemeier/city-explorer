Add an environment variable to your server named EVENTBRITE_API_KEY, and use it appropriately in your code.

Create a route with a method of get and a path of /events. The callback should make a Superagent-proxied request to the EventBrite API using the necessary location information.

Create a corresponding constructor function for the result.

For each event in the result, return an object which contains the necessary information for correct client rendering. See the sample response.

Use your existing error handler function.

Redeploy your application.
